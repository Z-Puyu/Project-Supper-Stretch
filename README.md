# Project: Supper Stretch

Disclaimer: The project code is simply a deliberate coincidence with a certain popular location in the university where the creator of this game is currently studying in, and it may or may not truly reflect the game's contents.

## Overview

Project: Supper Stretch is a **self-initiated student game development project** whose aim is mainly to *practise implementing various commonly seen mechanics in role-playing video games*. **Due to the limited manpower, it is to be expected that the game is poorly balanced and feels incomplete in terms of level design and contents**.

Project: Supper Stretch is a third-person roguelike RPG featuring a dark-fantasy style. You play as an adventurer waking up in a cursed dungeon, finding no way out. To keep himself alive, you have to salvage anything useful in the dungeon, including equipments, valuables, and... anything that "seems to be" **edible**! Yes, Project: Supper Stretch elevates the dungeon adventure experience, especially in terms of realism, by completely discarding the idea of acquiring buffs through potions and amulets. Instead, you need to collect all sorts of bizarre and suspicious materials in the dungeon in order to **cook your food**! These can be plants grown in the dungeon, edible ingredients you found in the chests, or even fresh harvest from a hellish creature you have just killed.

Interestingly, the inspiration of Project: Supper Stretch came from a Japanese anime
